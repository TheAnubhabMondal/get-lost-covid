                <h2>What is Corona Virus</h2>
                <p>Corona viruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness
                    in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known
                    to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more
                    severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)
                    and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently
                    discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.

                 <h2>What is Covid19?</h2>
                 <p>COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently
                    discovered corona virus. This new virus and disease were unknown
                    before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. </p>

                 <h2>How does COVID-19 spread?</h2>
                 <p>People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The
                    disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from
                    the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19
                    coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces
                    around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching
                    these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
                    People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a
                    person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is
                    why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a
                    person who is sick.

                 <h2>Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air</h2>
                 <p>Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly
                    transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than
                    through the air. See previous answer on “How does COVID-19 spread?

                    disease?</h2>
                  <h3>Protection measures for everyone 
                </h3>
                <p>Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak,
                    available on the national,state and local public health authority. Many
                    countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several
                    have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries
                    have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the
                    situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.<br>
                    You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID19 by taking some simple precautions:   </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcoholbased hand rub or wash them with soap and water.
                                Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using
                                alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands. </li>
                            <li>Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and
                                anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
                                Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid
                                droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you
                                are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the
                                COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease. </li>
                            <li>Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.
                                Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses.
                                Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes,
                                nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and
                                can make you sick. 
                                </li>
                            <li>Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good
                                respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose
                                with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze</li>
                            <li>Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and
                                difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance.
                                Follow the directions of your local health authority.
                                Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date
                                information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will
                                allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right
                                health facility</li>

                <h2>How likely am I to catch COVID-19?</h2>
                <p>The risk depends on where you are - and more specifically, whether
                    there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.
                    For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is
                    still low. However, there are now places around the world (cities or
                    areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting,
                    these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments
                    and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new
                    case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to comply with any local
                    restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with
                    disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading
                    COVID-19.
                    COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as
                    has been shown in China and some other countries. Unfortunately,
                    new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It’s important to be aware of the
                    situation where you are or intend to go.</p>

                <h2>Should I worry about COVID-19?</h2>
                <p>Illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for
                    children and young adults. However, it can cause serious illness:
                    about 1 in every 5 people who catch it need hospital care. It is
                    therefore quite normal for people to worry about how the COVID-19
                    outbreak will affect them and their loved ones.
                    We can channel our concerns into actions to protect ourselves, our
                    loved ones and our communities. First and foremost among these
                    actions is regular and thorough hand-washing and good respiratory
                    hygiene. Secondly, keep informed and follow the advice of the local
                    health authorities including any restrictions put in place on travel,
                    movement and gatherings. </p>

                <h2>Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the COVID-19?</h2>
                <p>No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on
                    bacterial infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do
                    not work. Antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or
                    treatment of COVID-19. They should only be used as directed by a
                    physician to treat a bacterial infection. </p>

                    COVID-19</h2>
                    <p>While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide
                        comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence
                        that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease. We does not
                        recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics,
                        as a prevention or cure for COVID-19. However, there are several
                        ongoing clinical trials that include both western and traditional
                        medicines. We will continue to provide updated information as soon
                        as clinical findings are available.</p>

                <h2>Is there a vaccine drug or treatment for COVID-19</h2>
                <p>Not yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine
                    to prevent or treat COVID-2019. However, those affected should
                    receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should
                    be hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care. 
                    Possible vaccines and some specific drug treatments are under
                    investigation. They are being tested through clinical trials.
                    The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against
                    COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with
                    the bend of elbow or tissue, and maintain a distance of at least 1
                    meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing</p>

                </h2>
                <p>Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially
                    coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19.
                    Disposable face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or
                    looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is
                    a world-wide shortage of masks, so We urge people to use masks
                    wisely.
                    We advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary
                    wastage of precious resources and mis-use of masks The most
                    effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to
                    frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow
                    or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from
